My application serves as a comprehensive platform empowering users to effortlessly update their vehicle information. Throughout the project's development, I encountered various challenges, notably in implementing personalized database entries for diverse user profiles and integrating GitHub authentication seamlessly. Leveraging my familiarity with GitHub's tools and its robust support for authentication, I opted for GitHub authentication.

In terms of design, I employed the widely acclaimed CSS framework, Bootstrap, renowned for its timeless elegance and reliability. While adhering to Bootstrap's conventions, I tailored certain elements to fulfill specific project requirements. I amalgamated my custom styling, housed in 'login.css', 'main.css', and 'signUp.css', with Bootstrap's framework, ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing interface.

Moreover, I implemented middleware for key functionalities such as user addition, login validation, and signup processes. Within the login middleware, I validate user existence before granting access or issuing alerts accordingly. Similarly, the signup middleware efficiently handles user registration by confirming non-existence prior to account creation. The add middleware seamlessly integrates new data into the database, ensuring smooth operation and data integrity throughout the application.
